How the funtion works.

array_max is the highest value in the array
array_min is the lowest value in the array
I used sorted() so as not to tamper with order of the original list

The for loops(doing the sub-setting);
for every index postion, i'm taking all possible slicing from index 0 up to that index
The sub_lists variable holds all the possible slicing/subset from above

The return statement;
I'm checking my sub_lists for every list that contains the max and miniumum values of the array
Then i'm returning the one with the minimum length(the smallest list that contains the max and min)
